  <!-- The scripts need to be in the body DOM element, as some test running frameworks need the body
       to have already been created so they can insert their magic into it. For example, if loaded
       before body, Angular Scenario test framework fails to find the body and crashes and burns in
       an epic manner. -->

  This HTML file is a template.
  If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

  You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
  The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

  To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
  To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
